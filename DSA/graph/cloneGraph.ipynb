    "Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\n",

    "    1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.\n",
    "    2. The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.\n",
    "    3. Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.\n",
    "    4. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph."
